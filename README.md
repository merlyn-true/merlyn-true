I'm a **data analyst and systems engineer** passionate about transforming messy, real-world data into clarity and automation. Since 2019, I've taught myself Excel, Power Query, VBA, Power BI, SQL, and Python — and now I’m building a full data analytics portfolio to showcase the work behind my learning journey.

I currently support analytics for **[N0MaD Group](https://www.n0madgroup.com/)**, **[ArtQuake Studios](https://www.artquakestudios.com/)**, and **[Gotta Dance](https://www.gottadance.ca/)**, creating dashboards, automations, websites, and processes that help teams operate more intelligently.
